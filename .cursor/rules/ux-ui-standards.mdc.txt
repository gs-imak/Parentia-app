# Cursor Rules — UI & UX Standards (Senior-Reviewed)

These rules are mandatory.  
All UI and UX decisions must assume continuous review by a senior UX/UI designer.  
If a choice feels questionable, it is wrong and must be corrected.

---

## 1. Core Principle

Design quality is not optional.

- No UI element exists without purpose
- No spacing is arbitrary
- No interaction is accidental
- No visual inconsistency is acceptable

Always favor clarity, hierarchy, and restraint over creativity for its own sake.

---

## 2. Spacing & Layout Rules

### Global Spacing System

- Use a 4pt or 8pt spacing system only
- Spacing must be consistent vertically and horizontally
- Never mix random values (e.g. 7px, 13px)

Recommended scale:
- 4
- 8
- 12
- 16
- 24
- 32
- 48
- 64

### Padding & Margins

- Interactive elements must have a minimum 44px touch target
- Cards and containers must have clear internal padding
- Content should breathe, never feel cramped

### Alignment

- Align elements to a clear grid
- Avoid optical misalignment
- Left alignment is default unless intentionally centered

---

## 3. Visual Hierarchy

Hierarchy must be immediately readable.

### Typography Hierarchy

- One primary font family
- Clear size progression
- Consistent line heights

Rules:
- Headings must visually dominate body text
- Body text must never compete with headings
- Line height should improve readability, not density

### Weight & Contrast

- Use weight changes sparingly
- Contrast must meet accessibility standards
- Never rely on color alone to convey meaning

---

## 4. Component Design Rules

### Buttons

- One primary action per screen
- Secondary actions must not visually compete
- Destructive actions must be clearly differentiated

Button rules:
- Consistent height
- Clear states: default, hover, active, disabled
- No vague labels (e.g. "OK", "Submit")

### Inputs & Forms

- Labels must always be visible
- Errors must be specific and helpful
- Required fields must be clearly indicated

Never:
- Hide labels inside placeholders only
- Trigger errors without explanation

---

## 5. Color Usage

Color is functional, not decorative.

Rules:
- Limited palette
- One primary brand color
- One accent color
- Neutral background dominance

Never:
- Use color randomly
- Overuse accent colors
- Reduce contrast for aesthetics

---

## 6. Feedback & States

Every user action must have feedback.

Required states:
- Loading
- Success
- Error
- Empty
- Disabled

Rules:
- Feedback must be immediate
- Messages must be human and clear
- No silent failures

---

## 7. Motion & Animation

Motion supports understanding, not flair.

Rules:
- Subtle
- Fast
- Purpose-driven

Never:
- Animate for decoration only
- Block user actions with animation
- Use inconsistent easing or durations

---

## 8. Accessibility Standards

Accessibility is mandatory.

Minimum requirements:
- Keyboard navigable
- Screen reader friendly
- Sufficient contrast
- Logical focus order

If accessibility is questionable, it must be fixed.

---

## 9. Consistency Rules

- Components must be reusable
- Same interaction must behave the same everywhere
- Same visual pattern must mean the same thing everywhere

No exceptions.

---

## 10. Decision Validation Checklist

Before finalizing any UI or UX decision, confirm:

- Is this clear in under 2 seconds?
- Is the hierarchy obvious?
- Is spacing intentional?
- Is this consistent with the rest of the system?
- Would a senior designer approve this without comment?

If any answer is no, revise.

---

## 11. Enforcement Rule

If a design decision conflicts with these rules:

- These rules win
- No shortcuts
- No temporary hacks
- No excuses

Design quality is part of the product.
